1. To retrieve the names of employees along with their department names, you can use a LEFT JOIN to include employees who don't belong to any department. Here's an example query:

sql
SELECT e.Name, COALESCE(d.DepartmentName, 'Unassigned') AS DepartmentName
FROM EmployeeTable e
LEFT JOIN DepartmentTable d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;


2. To find the total number of employees in each department, you can use the COUNT function along with GROUP BY. Here's an example query:

sql
SELECT d.DepartmentName, COUNT(e.EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees
FROM DepartmentTable d
LEFT JOIN EmployeeTable e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;


3. To find departments where the average salary is greater than 5500.00, you can use the AVG function and a HAVING clause. Here's an example query:

sql
SELECT d.DepartmentName
FROM DepartmentTable d
LEFT JOIN EmployeeTable e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
HAVING AVG(e.Salary) > 5500.00;


4. To retrieve the names and hire dates of employees hired after '2022-03-01', you can use a simple WHERE clause. Here's an example query:

sql
SELECT Name, HireDate
FROM EmployeeTable
WHERE HireDate > '2022-03-01';


5. To calculate the average salary for each employee along with their salary, effective date, and the difference between their salary and the average salary, you can use a subquery. Here's an example query:

sql
SELECT e.Name, e.Salary, e.EffectiveDate, e.Salary - avg_salary AS SalaryDifference
FROM EmployeeTable e
JOIN (
    SELECT AVG(Salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM EmployeeTable
) AS subquery
ORDER BY e.Name;
